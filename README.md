## Episodes

### Episode 1 - number of islands

You have a map based off a grid of size X by Y. Each grid cell is either marked as land or sea.
Assuming all around the grid is sea, your job is to calculate the number of islands on the map.

An island is defined as a continuous set of grid cells of land that connect either above, below, left or right with another land cell. Diagonal connections are not allowed.

#### Example

Here is a grid of 6x12:

The blue cells are sea, the green cells are land. This map has 6 islands:

You can find the final code for this in the [`number-of-islands`](./number-of-islands/) folder.
